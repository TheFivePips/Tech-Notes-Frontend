This is the front end of the techNotes app. It covers React, redux(toolkit), RTK query, react & redux forms, Auth with jsonwebtokens and more

The app is a hypothetical website for a computer repair shop that allows for employees to log in. There are protected routes depending on what type of employee is logged in, and each employee has Notes that indicate a project they are to work on. These notes and employees can be views, edited, updated, created, and deleted by users with the proper credentials.

This is a code along project by Dave Gray
